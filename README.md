My Portfolio Website.

## Technologies Used
- Mainly used HTML/CSS/Javascript due to the nature of the website being a simple portfolio website. Extensive backend wasn't a necessity, so a simple HTML website with focus on CSS styling was the ideal.
- Depending on how I want to further develop the website, I might introduce accounts, which would been SQLite integration, which in turn would most likely force flask-based backend integration.
